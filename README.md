## AI Security & Safety Blog
This repository hosts a technical blog focused on the security and safety of modern AI systems and Agents.
The goal of this project is to analyze AI in Defensive Operations like securing Code, Infrastructure, threat modeling, incident response, GRC and IAM from the lens of traditional cybersecurity disciplines.
The content is from a security engineer’s perspective and aims to bridge the gap between AI research and real-world senario risks.

## Research Focus Areas


### 1. Defensive AI for Secure Code
- AI-assisted secure code review and vulnerability discoveries.
- Detection of insecure patterns aligned with CVE's and OWASP Top 10.
- Analyzing Secure by design guidance during the development lifecycle.
- Risks and limitations of AI assisted development tools.


### 2. Defensive AI for Infrastructure Security
- AI-driven anomaly detection across networks, workloads, and cloud systems.
- Configuration risk analysis and privilege escalation discoveries.
- Alert prioritization and signal correlation for SOC operations.


### 3. Threat Modeling AI Systems
- Identification of assets, adversaries, and trust boundaries in AI-driven security tooling.
- Extension of classical threat modeling frameworks (STRIDE, CIA) to AI systems.
- Analysis of AI-specific failure modes, including hallucinations and misuse.


### 4. Incident Response for AI-Driven Security Systems
- Detection and triage of AI misbehavior.
- Containment strategies when AI produces unsafe or incorrect outputs.
- Post-incident analysis and continuous improvement for AI-based defenses.


### 5. Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)
- Mapping defensive AI use cases to regulatory expectations (HIPAA, PCI-DSS and general security controls).
- Accountability, auditability, and documentation of AI driven security decisions.
- Risk management strategies for deploying AI in regulated work environments.

### 6. Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- AI assisted detection of anomalous identity behavior.
- Role and privilege analysis using AI.
- Safeguards for AI systems interacting with identity infrastructure.
